data <- read.csv("variable_selection_data.csv", header = TRUE)

```{r}

highlyCorrelated <- findCorrelation(correlationMatrix, cutoff=0.5)
print(highlyCorrelated)
```

The only two highly correlated variables are the NLP features. They are only highly correlated because they are both 0 for all of the "NA" description cycles and positive for all the non-"NA" description cycles. As a result, this filtering does not provide any insight into removal of irrelevant variables in this preprocessing stage.
